**δHBV 2.0** is a state-of-the-art, distributed differentiable HBV model leveraging intelligent parameterization, big data, and highly-parallelized GPU compute with PyTorch to deliver CONUS-scale, high-resolution inference of parameters and fluxes.

This repository serves as an **operations-level module** for NOAA-OWP’s [Next Generation National Water Modeling Framework (NextGen)](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen). It provides **Basic Model Interface (BMI)** adapters for two modeling modalities:

1. **δHBV 2.0**: Daily timestep simulation.
2. **δHBV 2.0 MTS**: Hourly timestep simulation using a Multi-TimeScale (MTS) architecture.

## Model Descriptions

> Models are built on the generic differentiable modeling framework [δMG](https://github.com/mhpi/generic_deltamodel).

### 1. δHBV 2.0 (Daily)

*First introduced by Song et al. (2024) [[1]](#publications).*

The daily model uses an LSTM and MLP to learn parameters for the differentiable physical model HBV 2.0. Weather forcings (precipitation, temperature, PET) and static catchment attributes are used as inputs to simulate hydrological states and fluxes:

$$
    \begin{align}
    \theta_{d, m}^{1:t} &= \text{LSTM}( x_m^{1:t}, A_m ) \\
    \theta_{s, m} &= \text{MLP}( A_m ) \\
    Q_k^{1:t}, S_k^{1:t} &= \text{HBV}(x_m^{1:t}, \theta_{d, m}^{1:t}, \theta_{s, m})
    \end{align}
$$

where:

* $\theta$: Learned dynamic ($d$) and static ($s$) parameters.
* $x_m, A_m$: Forcings and attributes for unit basin $m$.
* $Q, S$: Model fluxes (e.g., streamflow) and states (e.g., snowpack).

### 2. δHBV 2.0 MTS (Hourly)

*Introduced by Yang et al. (2025) [[2]](#publications).*

The **Multi-TimeScale (MTS)** variant adapts the architecture for hourly simulation. It incorporates a rolling window input caching mechanism to bridge the gap between long-term hydrologic memory and high-frequency forcing:

* **Caching:** Caches ~351 days of aggregated daily inputs and ~7 days of hourly inputs.
* **Warmup:** Performs warmup steps using the cache to prime low-frequency (daily) and high-frequency (hourly) model states before generating hourly predictions.
* **Rolling Window**: After 7 days of hourly simulation, the cache window shifts forward 7 days and the warmup is repeated.

> Note: To run a simulation in NextGen for a given time period, the **prior 358 days** of forcing data must be included in the input to satisfy warmup described above.
>
> E.g., simulations starting 01/01/2009 01:00 require an input dataset timeseries starting at 01/08/2008 01:00.
