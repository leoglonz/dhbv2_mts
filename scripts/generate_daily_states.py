Generate daily dhbv2 model states for MTS hourly dhbv2 model.

This must be run for every spatiotemporal simulation region. Furthermore,
*for best results*, 351 days of data are require prior to the start date of the
simulation in order to properly spin up these model states.
This may change in future versions.
